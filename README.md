UForm is a Multi-Modal Modal Inference package, designed to encode Multi-Lingual Texts, Images, and, soon, Audio, Video, and Documents, into a shared vector space!
It comes with a set of homonymous pre-trained networks available on [HuggingFace portal](https://huggingface.co/unum-cloud/uform) and extends the `transfromers` package to support Mid-fusion Models.

## Three Kinds of Multi-Modal Encoding

![Early, Mid and Late Fusion Transformer Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unum-cloud/uform/main/assets/model_types_bg.png)

__Late-fusion models__ encode each modality independently, but into one shared vector space.
Due to independent encoding late-fusion models are good at capturing coarse-grained features but often neglect fine-grained ones.
This type of models is well-suited for retrieval in large collections.
The most famous example of such models is CLIP by OpenAI.

__Early-fusion models__ encode both modalities jointly so they can take into account fine-grained features.
Usually, these models are used for re-ranking relatively small retrieval results.

__Mid-fusion models__ are the golden midpoint between the previous two types.
Mid-fusion models consist of two parts â€“ unimodal and multimodal.
The unimodal part allows encoding each modality separately as late-fusion models do.
The multimodal part takes unimodal features from the unimodal part as input and enhances them with a cross-attention mechanism.

This tiny package will help you deal with the last!

## Installation

```bash
pip install uform
```

UForm v0.3.0 and below depends on `transformers` and `timm` libraries, all newer versions depend only on PyTorch (except libraries for the text tokenization and checkpoint downloading). For the best performance, Pytorch v2.0.0 and above is recommended.

## Usage

To load the model:

```python
import uform

model = uform.get_model('unum-cloud/uform-vl-english')
model = uform.get_model('unum-cloud/uform-vl-multilingual')
```

You can also load your own Mid-fusion model. Just upload it on HuggingFace and pass model name to `get_model`.

To encode data:

```python
from PIL import Image

text = 'a small red panda in a zoo'
image = Image.open('red_panda.jpg')

image_data = model.preprocess_image(image)
text_data = model.preprocess_text(text)

image_embedding = model.encode_image(image_data)
text_embedding = model.encode_text(text_data)
joint_embedding = model.encode_multimodal(image=image_data, text=text_data)
```

Retrieving features is also trivial:

```python
image_features, image_embedding = model.encode_image(image_data, return_features=True)
text_features, text_embedding = model.encode_text(text_data, return_features=True)
```

These features can later be used to produce joint multimodal encodings faster, as the first layers of the transformer can be skipped:

```python
joint_embedding = model.encode_multimodal(
    image_features=image_features,
    text_features=text_features,
    attention_mask=text_data['attention_mask']
)
```

### Remote Procedure Calls for Cloud Deployments

You can also use our larger, faster, better proprietary models deployed in optimized cloud environments.
For that, please, choose the cloud of liking, search the marketplace for "Unum UForm" and reinstall UForm with optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install uform[remote]
```

The only thing that changes after that is calling `get_client` with the IP address of your instance instead of using `get_model` for local usage.

```python
model = uform.get_client('0.0.0.0:7000')
```


## Evaluation

There are two options to calculate semantic compatibility between an image and a text: [Cosine Similarity](#cosine-similarity) and [Matching Score](#matching-score).

### Cosine Similarity

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

similarity = F.cosine_similarity(image_embedding, text_embedding)
```

The `similarity` will belong to the `[-1, 1]` range, `1` meaning the absolute match.

__Pros__:

- Computationally cheap.
- Only unimodal embeddings are required, unimodal encoding is faster than joint encoding.
- Suitable for retrieval in large collections.

__Cons__:

- Takes into account only coarse-grained features.


### Matching Score 

Unlike cosine similarity, unimodal embedding are not enough.
Joint embedding will be needed and the resulting `score` will belong to the `[0, 1]` range, `1` meaning the absolute match.

```python
score = model.get_matching_scores(joint_embedding)
```

__Pros__:

- Joint embedding captures fine-grained features.
- Suitable for re-ranking - sorting retrieval result.

__Cons__:

- Resource-intensive.
- Not suitable for retrieval in large collections.

### Architecture

| Model        | Language Tower | Image Tower | Multimodal Part |                     URL |
| :----------- | :------------: | :---------: | :-------------: | ----------------------: |
| English      | BERT, 2 layers |  ViT-B/16   |    2 layers     | [weights.pt][weights-e] |
| Multilingual | BERT, 8 layers |  ViT-B/16   |    4 layers     | [weights.pt][weights-m] |

The Multilingual model supports 11 languages, after being trained on a balanced dataset.
For pre-training we used translated captions made with [NLLB](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb).
